# GFW-Fires
> Please read this before beginning development to learn how to get started and how to change some simple components of the application.

## Getting Started

<p>This project has a few dependencies you will need installed to get started.</p>

### Installing node.js if you do not have it already.
<p>View the <a href='http://nodejs.org/'>node.js</a> homepage and install.</p>

### Installing Gulp if you do not have it already.
<p>View the <a href='http://gulpjs.com'>Gulp</a> homepage.  If you have node installed, you can just run: <pre><code>npm install --global gulp</code></pre>

### Clone the Repo
<p>If you haven't already done so, clone the repo.</p>

### Installing the remaining dependencies for Gulp.
<p>Make sure you are in the project folder you just cloned down and run <pre><code>npm install</code></pre></p>

### NOTE: For Mac users
<p>Installing node and any dependencies via ```npm``` may require you to run the commands with ```sudo```.

### Next Steps
<p>Now that you have all your dependencies installed.  You can start developing.  We are using a task runner to process .styl files.  The task runner has some preconfigured tasks for you to use.

#### gulp watch
Run <code>gulp watch</code> from your project directory
<p>This will run a watch task to listen for any changes to stylus files and compile them into css files.</p>

#### gulp build
Run <code>gulp build</code> from your project directory.
<p>This will do everything necessary to generate a minified build for this project.  It will minify images, .styl files, JavaScript, and html and will also copy over any remaining dependencies that are needed and place them in the build directory.</p>

## Configurations

#### Coming Soon
<p>We will post some examples of how to make some simple text changes to labels in the app via different config files in the project.</p>

## Git Workflow

#### Coming Soon
<p>Where to commit and what branch to branch off of as well as which branch will have the latest code.</p>

## Contribution
<p> See Git Workflow above to know how and where to commit your code.</p>
##### NOTE: DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COMMIT ANY CREDENTIALS OF ANY KIND
